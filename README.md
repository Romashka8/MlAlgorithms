# âœ… About

In this repository, I have collected classic machine learning algorithms that are implemented in Python using numpy and pandas. I have attempted to structure the repository in a manner similar to the sklearn library.

# âœ… Structure

Repo have following sections:

- LInear models
- Metric models
- Tree models
- Ensembles
- Decomposition

In each section, you will find a README.md file that explains the main idea behind the section. There is also Python code that implements the algorithms, and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how the algorithms can be applied. If you do not see any of these items, do not be alarmed, as they may not have been added yetðŸ¤—.

# âœ… How to use this rep

Open the interesting section, read the README.md file, learn the code, and try the notebooks!
